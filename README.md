# E-Commerce Shopping Management System

## Introduction
Shopping Management system developed using Java Spring Boot. It provides a robust foundation for managing an online store with features like product, cart, and order management, allowing users to shop online and place orders seamlessly.

## Features
- **Entities:** Includes core entities such as `Cart`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `user` and `Product`, with well-defined relationships.
- **Architecture:** Follows follows an `MVC architecture` by separating the application into `Model`, which handles data and business logic; `View`, which manages the user interface (e.g., JSON or Thymeleaf); and `Controller`, which processes requests and directs data flow. This ensures clean code, scalability, and maintainability.
